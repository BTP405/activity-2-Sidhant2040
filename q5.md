ANS 5. 
i) Approach 1:

Here the program creates a list of numbers where each number is twice its corresponding position in the range from 0 to n-1. After that it prints each number followed by colon(:)

Approach 2:

Here the program directly creates a list. It generates a list where each number is twice its corresponding position in the range from 0 to 4. It then prints each number followed by colon(:)

Approach 3:

Here the program defines a generator function. Instead of creating a list, it generates numbers where each number is twice its corresponding position in the range from 0 to n-1. It then prints each number followed by colon(:)

ii) The doubleG function is like a magic that makes numbers appear one by one on the screen. It is also known as generator because it creates these numbers on spot.

The advantage of using doubleG is that it is smart. Instead of making a big list of all the numbers at once it only gives us one when we ask for it. This is helpful when there are lots of numbers, saving memory and making things work faster.
